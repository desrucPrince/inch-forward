# InchForward

InchForward: Make daily progress on your goals, one small step at a time.

## What is InchForward?

InchForward is an iOS application designed to help you achieve your long-term goals by breaking them down into small, manageable daily tasks. The core idea is to focus on making consistent, incremental progress – "inching forward" – every day, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the entirety of a large goal. By completing one small "move" each day, you build momentum and steadily work towards your aspirations.

## Key Features

*   **Goal Creation:** Define your overarching objectives you want to achieve.
*   **Daily Moves:** Break down each goal into small, actionable steps, known as "moves," each with an estimated duration.
*   **Focused Daily Task:** Each day, InchForward presents you with a single "move" to focus on for your selected goal.
*   **Progress Tracking & Flexibility:**
    *   Mark your daily move as "Done" upon completion.
    *   "Swap" your current move for a different one if your priorities or energy levels change.
    *   "Postpone" a move for later in the day.
    *   "Skip" a move if you're unable to complete it, without losing sight of the main goal.
*   **SwiftData Persistence:** Your goals, moves, and progress are saved locally using SwiftData.

## How it Works

1.  **Create a Goal:** Start by defining a clear goal you want to work towards. Give it a title and an optional description.
2.  **Define Moves:** For each goal, list several small, concrete actions ("moves") that contribute to achieving it. Assign an estimated time to each move.
3.  **Get Your Daily Move:** Each day, the app will show you one move for your active goal.
4.  **Take Action:**
    *   Complete the move and mark it as "Done".
    *   If needed, "Swap" it for another move associated with the same goal.
    *   "Postpone" it if you plan to do it later in the day.
    *   "Skip" it if you can't get to it, and a new move will be available tomorrow.
5.  **Inch Forward:** Consistently completing these small moves helps you build momentum and make steady progress towards your larger objectives.

## Technical Stack

*   **Framework:** SwiftUI for the user interface and application structure.
*   **Data Persistence:** SwiftData for local data storage.
*   **Language:** Swift
*   **Platform:** iOS
