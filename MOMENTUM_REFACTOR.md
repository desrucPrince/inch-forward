# Momentum-Building AI Suggestions Refactor

## Overview

This refactor enhances the InchForward app to track completed moves and use them as context for AI-generated suggestions, creating a momentum-building system that ensures actions progressively advance toward goals. Additionally, it includes current date context to ensure realistic timelines and prevent past-date suggestions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Completed Moves Tracking

**New Methods in `GoalViewModel`:**
- `getLastThreeCompletedMoves()` - Retrieves the last 3 completed moves across all days
- `formatCompletedMovesForPrompt()` - Formats completed and existing moves for AI context
- `getCurrentExistingMoves()` - Gets current moves to avoid duplicates
- `getRecentCompletedMoves(limit:)` - Public method for UI display
- `getCompletedMovesDisplayText(limit:)` - Formatted text for display

### 2. Date Context Awareness

**New Methods in `GoalViewModel`:**
- `getCurrentDateContext()` - Provides formatted current date for AI prompts

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents AI from suggesting past dates in goals
- ✅ Ensures realistic future timelines based on current date
- ✅ Provides temporal context for more relevant suggestions

### 3. Enhanced AI Prompts

**Context Inclusion:**
- Last 3 completed moves with titles and descriptions
- List of existing moves to prevent duplicates
- **Current date with instructions for realistic timelines**
- Enhanced system instruction emphasizing momentum building and future-focused dates

**Example Enhanced Prompt:**
```
My current goal is: "Smart Goals App iOS Launch by 12/31/2024". Description: "Successfully launch and list...".

Recent completed moves (most recent first):
1. "Develop Core App Features" - Complete the core features of the Smart Goals App...
2. "Design User Interface" - Create intuitive and user-friendly interface...

Existing moves already available:
1. "Test App Functionality"

Current date: Friday, May 23, 2025
Please ensure all dates, timelines, and deadlines are realistic and in the future relative to this current date.

Suggest 3-5 concise, actionable steps (moves) to help achieve this goal...
```

### 4. UI Enhancements

**GoalAndMoveView:**
- Added "RECENT PROGRESS" section showing completed moves
- Visual indicators with checkmarks and progress icons

**SwapMoveView:**
- Added "Builds on progress" indicator for AI suggestions
- Shows when suggestions are contextually aware of previous work

### 5. System Improvements

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents duplicate move suggestions
- ✅ Creates logical progression of actions
- ✅ Builds momentum by acknowledging completed work
- ✅ Provides better user experience with relevant suggestions
- ✅ Enables compound progress toward goals
- ✅ **Ensures realistic timelines with current date awareness**
- ✅ **Prevents goals with past deadlines**

**Debug Features:**
- Console logging of completed moves included in AI context
- Console logging of current date context inclusion
- Tracking of moves count and titles for debugging

## Usage

The system automatically:
1. Tracks all completed moves via `DailyProgress` entries
2. Includes the last 3 completed moves in AI prompts
3. **Includes current date context in all AI requests**
4. Avoids suggesting duplicate or similar actions
5. Creates suggestions that build upon previous work
6. **Ensures all suggested timelines are realistic and future-focused**

No additional user action required - the momentum building and date awareness happen automatically when generating new moves or formatting goals.

## Technical Implementation

**Data Flow:**
1. User completes a move → `recordDailyProgress()` stores it
2. AI suggestion request → `getLastThreeCompletedMoves()` retrieves context
3. Current date context → `getCurrentDateContext()` provides temporal awareness
4. Context formatted → `formatCompletedMovesForPrompt()` creates prompt text
5. Enhanced prompt sent → AI generates progressive, temporally-aware suggestions
6. UI displays → Progress indicators show momentum awareness

**Date Context:**
- Current date formatted as: "Friday, May 23, 2025"
- Included in both SMART goal formatting and move suggestions
- AI instructed to ensure realistic future timelines
- System instruction updated to emphasize temporal accuracy

**Storage:**
- Completed moves stored in `DailyProgress.moveCompleted`
- Linked to goals via relationships
- Sorted by date for chronological context
- No additional storage overhead

This refactor transforms the app from generating random suggestions with potentially outdated timelines to creating intelligent, progressive action sequences that build meaningful momentum toward goal achievement with realistic, future-focused deadlines.
